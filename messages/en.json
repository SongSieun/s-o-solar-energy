  "faq": {
    "sectionTitle": "FAQ",
    "sectionSubtitle": "Find answers to commonly asked questions",
    "q1": "Do you handle installation as well?",
    "a1": "S&O Solar Energy does not provide installation services, and our review process is completely independent. However, after the review is completed, we can introduce verified contractors if desired. The same objective analysis is provided regardless of contractor introduction, and we do not receive any commissions or rebates for introductions.",
    "q2": "What documents do you need?",
    "a2": "We basically need site information (location, area, building use) and electricity usage data. If you've already received proposals or quotes, sending those along enables a more accurate review. For example, for a factory rooftop, building plans, the past year's electricity bills, and KEPCO contract power information enable precise analysis.",
    "q3": "How much does the review cost?",
    "a3": "Pricing varies based on review scope and complexity. Basic feasibility reviews start at 300,000 KRW, and detailed analysis including generation simulation ranges from 500,000 to 1,000,000 KRW. Complex large-scale projects (500kW+) receive custom quotes. Initial pre-consultation (within 30 minutes) is free.",
    "q4": "Can you verify if a contractor's generation claims are exaggerated?",
    "a4": "Yes, that's exactly what our core service does. In a real case, a client's proposal stated '15% annual return,' but our analysis showed it was actually 8-9%. We comprehensively review solar irradiance data, shade analysis, system efficiency, and inverter losses to calculate realistic generation figures.",
    "q5": "Can I request just a contract review?",
    "a5": "Yes, that's possible. If you've already selected a contractor but need a pre-contract terms review, you can use just the contract verification service. We identify unfavorable clauses regarding warranty conditions, performance guarantees, defect liability, and delay damages, and suggest negotiation points.",
    "q6": "How long does the review take?",
    "a6": "Generally, it takes 3-5 business days after receiving documents. Basic feasibility review takes 2-3 days, and if detailed generation analysis is included, about 4-5 days. For urgent cases, express service (within 2 days, 30% surcharge) is available.",
    "q7": "Do you review small residential solar systems?",
    "a7": "Yes, we can review residential solar systems under 10kW. However, for small-scale projects, analysis costs can be burdensome relative to the investment, so we offer a streamlined 'Quick Check Service' (150,000 KRW) that covers key figure verification and essential points.",
    "q8": "Do you review permits and grid connection?",
    "a8": "Yes, our feasibility review includes assessment of permitting possibilities and grid connection conditions. For example, for farmland, we check agricultural land conversion permit requirements, development restriction zone status, KEPCO substation distance, and available connection capacity. However, we do not handle the actual permit application process."
